# Kevinâ€™s dotfiles

This repo is for me and forked directly from  [mathias](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/)

If you want to learn more check out his work.

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```
